# SystemC-Canny-edge-detector
<div>
Introduction: 
</div>
<ul>
  <li>This project uses a specific image processing application, namely an implementation of the Canny Edge Detector algorithm.
  <li> Design a suitable embedded system model of this application and describe it in the IEEE SystemC System-Level Description Language (SLDL).
  <li>The created embedded specification model will then be simulated for functional validation and later also be refined for real-time implementation on an embedded platform with a digital video camera.
